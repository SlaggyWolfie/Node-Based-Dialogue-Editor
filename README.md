**Node-based Dialogue Editor**

With the Node-based Dialogue Editor you can create a Dialogue Graph in Unity, in which you can build branching dialogue based on data (player choices and actions) through the use of a light scripting system that extends the concept of nodes. 

The Dialogue Editor is a Unity Editor Window that displays a Node Graph, a data structure that holds Nodes and Connections. Nodes are connected via Connections to build a flow. The flow can be branched to create complex conversations with multiple outcomes. Unityâ€™s Asset system was used to store Nodes and Connections inside a Graph which was stored in a file and the Editor GUI was used to display these assets and allow interaction between them.

I am in the process of reworking this.
